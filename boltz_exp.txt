ne of the multinomial expressions (on bird vector V) is straightforward
to explain (mosquitoes are biting birds at random with a given probability p);
the other might ?? give sampling probabilities for the number of
ways of achieving that (since V is unordered)

The B^M can be thought of just as a normalization constant, or may be able
to think of it as the total number of ensembles

Let's take the example from the document. B=4, M=5, V={3,1,1,0}, S={1,2,0,1}.

The probability of {3,1,1,0} is multinomial prob of drawing bird 1 3 times; bird 2 once; bird 3 once; bird 0 zero times (language/justification for dividing 4!, the total number ofpermutations, by 3!1!1!0!, the number of permutations with this outcome ... ?)

Now we also have to enumerate the probability of
picking *particular* birds as the ones that are sampled a particular number of times,
i.e. distributing the mosquitoes among the birds (sum(S)=M) (??)
