one of the multinomial expressions (on bird vector V) is straightforward
to explain (mosquitoes are biting birds at random with a given probability p);
the other (???) is going to give sampling probabilities for the number of
ways of achieving that (since V is unordered)

The B^M can be thought of just as a normalization constant, or may be able
to think of it as the total number of ensembles
