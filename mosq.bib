	abstract = {The consequences of non-homogeneous mixing (non-random contact) between vectors and hosts for the persistence, prevalence, and hence control, of any mosquito-borne disease are explored. When mosquitoes concentrate on certain hosts, the basic reproductive rate, R, of the disease (a measure of persistence) and the vectorial capacity are both greater than or equal to their values under homogeneous mixing. Field data suggest that R could be more than two and a half times as large as it would be under homogeneous mixing. Our calculations underestimate the importance of heterogeneity by ignoring mosquito patchiness and stochastic effects. Host selection limits the dependability of predictions, made from population models which assume homogeneous mixing, about the success of disease control (vaccines, chemotherapy, vector control). In particular, eradication or the maintenance of low prevalence will be more difficult than expected, unless localized control makes the distribution of infective bites on a community more nearly uniform. Age may explain most of the variability in biting in small communities (e.g., rural villages), in which case models incorporating age-specific biting will be appropriate tools in control programmes.},

A nonparametric estimation technique is proposed to estimate the number of classes using the idea of sample coverage, which is defined as the sum of the cell probabilities of the observed classes. Since expected sample coverage can be well estimated, we were motivated to find its role in the estimation of the number of classes. This work generalizes the result of Esty to a nonparametric approach and extends Darroch and Ratcliff to incorporate the heterogeneity of the class probabilities. The coefficient of variation of the class sizes is shown to play an important role in the recommended estimation procedures. The performance of the proposed estimators is investigated by means of Monte Carlo simulations.},

	abstract = {A random sample is drawn from a population of animals of various species. {(The} theory may also be applied to studies of literary vocabulary, for example.) If a particular species is represented r times in the sample of size N, then {r/N} is not a good estimate of the population frequency, p, when r is small. Methods are given for estimating p, assuming virtually nothing about the underlying population. The estimates are expressed in terms of smoothed values of the numbers nr (r= 1, 2, 3, ...), where nr is the number of distinct species that are each represented r times in the sample. (nr may be described as ‘the frequency of the frequency r’.) Turing is acknowledged for the most interesting formula in this part of the work. An estimate of the proportion of the population represented by the species occurring in the sample is an immediate corollary. Estimates are made of measures of heterogeneity of the population, including Yule's ‘characteristic’ and Shannon's ‘entropy’. Methods are then discussed that do depend on assumptions about the underlying population. It is here that most work has been done by other writers. It is pointed out that a hypothesis can give a good fit to the numbers nr but can give quite the wrong value for Yule's characteristic. An example of this is Fisher's fit to some data of Williams's on Macrolepidoptera.},

	volume = {64},
	abstract = {Models of the within-host dynamics of parasites have been used to consider the evolution of microparasites causing acute infections in vertebrate hosts. In this paper, we use these models to examine how the level of virulence to which a parasite evolves, depends on factors such as the relationship between parasite density and its rate of transmission from infected hosts, and the mechanism of parasite-induced pathogenesis. We show that changes in the terms describing transmissibility and pathogenesis may lead to dramatic diﬀerences in the level of virulence to which a parasite evolves. This suggests that no single factor is likely to be responsible for the diﬀerences in virulence of diﬀerent parasites, and that understanding of the evolution of virulence of parasites will require a detailed quantitative understanding of the interaction between the parasite and its host. {(C)} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we consider the specific case of vector-borne parasites (inspired by human malaria) and analyse an embedded model to understand how specific life-cycle aspects may affect this trade-off. First, we find that, for such parasites, the transmission function may have an S-shape. Second, we find that the trade-off obtained for vector-borne parasites is less sensitive to parameter variations than the trade-off obtained for directly transmitted parasites. Third, we find that other parasite traits, such as the conversion from replicative to infective stages, could have important epidemiological implications. Finally, we compare the effect of treatments targeting either the asexual or the sexual parasite life-stage.},
